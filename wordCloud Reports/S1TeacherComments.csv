His writing is improving, but he needs to apply the literary devices, grammar, and punctuation we are studying consistently to his writing.  He has only started to tap into what I see as his considerable presentation skills.   I am looking forward to seeing how he takes off this second semester."Brems,"Alexandra has finally fit herself perfectly into the class.  She understands what is required of her and is responding with confidence and success.  Her five-paragraph essay written for the semester assessment is her best analytical writing to date.  She is an active thinker and pursues ideas until they are fully understood, seeming to enjoy the pursuit for its own sake.  She knows we will be working on presentation skills a lot this semester, and she knows which of those skills she needs to improve.  I am not sure she is very pleased about having to do this, but she is certainly willing."Brems,"Alexandro has made a huge leap in applying his critical and creative thinking to our studies in English literature.   His ability to communicate his ideas and insights during class discussion has grown markedly.  The challenge now is to get Alexandro to be able to express his thinking on paper.  He seems eager to take this challenge on, because he is really enjoying where his thinking is taking him."Brems,"Anaiah has adjusted quickly to her new environs and fits in well with her classmates and the curriculum.  She is a bit too quiet in class, and I wish she would volunteer more, but I am fairly certain that is not her natural style.  Still, I would like to hear what she is thinking or wondering.  She loves to write, but utilizing the strictures the MYP has established for writing may be a little difficult at first.  The writing contest is coming up in February, and I have every anticipation that Anaiah will enter."Brems,"Chwanzi is an excellent writer.  His abilities to analyze literature and put those analyses on paper clearly are coming to the fore.   At times, he drifts in class, but we will work on that this next semester, something that will be easy as he is really starting to enjoy and play with his abilities.  The writing contest is coming up in February, and I have every anticipation that Chwanzi will enter."Brems,"Elsa is really finding her stride within the English structures that we are studying. Her five-paragraph essay on the semester exam was the best writing she has done to date.   I would like to see her more active in class discussions, but I think that will happen naturally as we progress through the second semester."Brems,"Fei Ya has improved his communication skills both orally and in writing.  He also has come up with some keen insights into the literature we have been studying.  I try to call on him every class, but I would also like Fei Ya to raise his hand once each class.  I am sure he doesn’t miss a thing, but he has good ideas that I would like him to share.  The writing contest is coming up in February, and I have every anticipation that Fei Ya will enter."Brems,"Gillian is slowly but surely seeing that she has some real talent in English, but she seems reluctant to admit it.  She needs to approach her writing with confidence and start to take some joy in seeing her thinking on paper."Brems,"Grace is such a social person, but she is starting to see how that trait can at times get in the way of her tapping into her considerable talent.  There are times that Grace has truly shone in class, and I remind her that she needs to shine like that every day.   I would love to see what she is capable of doing if she applied herself 100%.  I think she would surprise herself.  The writing contest is coming up in February, and I would be very pleased to see Grace enter as she has a unique style and insight."Brems,"Harriet has very good thinking and communication skills.  Her presentations in class are well thought out and convincing.  She needs to establish a very solid base in grammar and punctuation so that she can concentrate on her writing style, which shows great potential.   The writing contest is coming up in February, and I have every anticipation that Harriet will enter."Brems,"Hussein is really eager to do well in English, and there are signs that he is starting to understand how to apply what we are learning in class.  His work in SEN is helping a great deal, but I went over his semester exam with him and realized there are some gaps in his ability to understand the application of concepts.  He did very well on his five-paragraph essay, much of which was prepared prior to the semester assessment, but his ability to make the logical connections during the exam to get correct answers from his notes to the paper were lacking.  I will go over his exam with the SEN instructor, and we will see how we can address his logical processes so they are more efficient."Brems,"Jeevan is maturing well, increasingly realizing what it means to be a good student and realizing as well that he actually is a good student.  His five-paragraph essay written for the semester assessment was the best writing he has done to date.  I would like to see Jeevan participate more actively in class discussions and activities.  He has good insights, and he needs to share them more readily."Brems,"Jihyun has a solid grasp of the concepts we have covered this semester, including the English conventions around grammar and punctuation.  She has a very active mind and is eager to participate in class activities.   Jihyun does struggle with applying what she has learned to her writing.  The more she writes, however, the better she will get at it.   She will have many opportunities to write this semester, both creatively during the poetry unit and analytically during our novel unit."Brems,"Johanna has adjusted rapidly to her new learning environment, both academically and socially.  She quickly got into the rhythm of the English class and has contributed to class discussions and activities.  Although she was not with us the entire semester, she took the semester assessment and did quite well.  Her five-paragraph essay gives a good measure of her strengths and what she needs to work on.  I am sure by the end of the second semester, she will be all caught up and meeting with many successes."Brems,"Joshua has only scratched the surface of his abilities.  He has the potential to be an excellent writer and public speaker.  He is not necessarily aware of this potential or how to get at it. We will work on getting it out of him this next semester.  The writing contest is coming up in February, and I have every anticipation that Joshua will enter."Brems,"Katherine has had moments of brilliance this semester. Her presentation skills are routinely excellent.  However, in class participation, writing, grammar and analysis of literature, she has been inconsistent and often easily distracted.   Part of this comes with the new friends she is making at a new school.  However, this coming semester, she needs to build on the considerable skills she has and apply herself consistently in class."Brems,"Marco is starting to come into his own in English class.  His five-paragraph essay written for the semester assessment was his best writing to date.   His assessments are showing gradual improvement as he starts to apply what we are studying in class to his writing and thinking.  Although he tries hard in class, he does allow himself to be distracted too easily.  If he were to become a more active learner, asking questions when he does not understand, contributing his ideas to discussions, and expanding his use of the grammar and punctuation we are studying to his writing, I am sure the distractions would disappear. "Brems,"Michela’s writing has improved so much this semester!  She really wants to be a good writer, and she is soaking up all the tips about writing and literary devices that we are covering in class.  She is an active learner, her confidence is high, and her clarity of expression is sharper every unit.  The writing contest is coming up in February, and I have every anticipation that Michela will enter."Brems,"Mwape has solid analytical skills, often making comments that show considerable insight.  However, she has not yet succeeded in getting those thoughts to paper in a clear and concise manner.  I am hoping that she will start to enjoy her ability to analyze and be excited about exploring her ideas with words and writing. "Brems,"Naested is a solid thinker and consistent participant in class discussions.   He sees relationships, “networking” information into connections. His writing has improved markedly since the first weeks of school.  I plan to push Naested this semester so that he can see how good he really can be."Brems,"Natasha is very enthusiastic about English!  Her efforts at disciplining her writing and analytical processes are really starting to pay off.   Her five-paragraph essay for her exam was the best writing she has done to date. The increasing clarity in Natasha’s writing is a strong indication that she is starting to avoid the distractions in her thinking that, at the beginning of the semester, sidetracked her into wasted time and dead-ends.   The upcoming units are going to be a lot of fun for Natasha."Brems,"One of the nicest transfers that Lara made this semester was the link between the grammar we have been studying and her Spanish class!   Tentative at first, Lara has come out of that shell completely and feels very much at home with the class.  She needs to focus on the details of her writing – word choice, grammar, punctuation, sequence, clarity – but it will come as she reflects more on what it is she really wants to say."Brems,"Oriana has not been as engaged as she was at the beginning of the semester.   She can be a remarkable student, but I think social distractions are taking her off her mark.  I would like to see her more engaged in class discussion and more attentive to her writing skills which have slipped a bit since the short story unit.  The writing contest is coming up in February, and I have every anticipation that Oriana will enter."Brems,"Oscar is on the verge of busting out all over.  His skills in English are considerable, his five-paragraph essay written for the semester assessment his best writing to date.  His contributions to class discussions are insightful and often original.  He does not always approach a task with all due seriousness, but rather with a confidence that “Yes, I will do well enough without 100% effort.”   This approach perhaps keeps him from realizing some of the finer aspects of the craft of writing, aspects that might actually inspire some incredible thinking and writing on his part."Brems,"Rashid has a strong desire to do well in English.   He pays attention in class and usually has answers when called upon, which I make a point of doing every class.   He needs to transfer the literary concepts and grammar covered in class to his writing, group work and assessments. "Brems,"Safwaan has had some very shining moments this semester.  His reading of a passage to the class showed great subtlety and charm, and he has often had the correct answer to a question (although he has to be coaxed to say it aloud).  However, these moments of success have not inspired him to be consistent in his efforts and attention.  Until Safwaan figures out what it means to be a high school student and decides to take up that role, he will not tap into the skills that he obviously has."Brems,"Sameera does not realize how good a student she can be.   There are times when she is the shining light in class with insights and comments that indicate truly great analysis.  However, there are lapses in her efforts as she decides that she wants to be distracted during class.   I see it happening and try to head it off, but once she is distracted, it is hard to get her back.  I think that if Sameera were to give 100%, she would enjoy where that takes her more than the distractions."Brems,"Shafuraisako handles the concrete concepts of grammar and punctuation very well.   What we will work on this second semester is her application of those concepts to her writing.   The poetry unit particularly will force her to think in different forms and to direct her words to fit them.  I wish she would ask questions when she does not understand something, and I also wish she would volunteer her thoughts during class discussion.  I will make sure that she has several successes this semester so that her confidence is given a boost."Brems,"Shayne is becoming a really good student.  Her progress since the beginning of the semester has been marked.  Her analysis of literature is becoming more refined and meaningful.  She participates enthusiastically in class and all activities and will really take off in the units we are covering this coming semester, particularly the poetry unit.  Her five-paragraph essay written for the semester assessment is the best writing she has done to date."Brems,"Stephen is developing a singular style in English.  He does not enjoy employing the rules of English to his work, but he is succeeding at getting some of his passions into his writing.   I am hoping that he will start to see the abilities of English language structures to help him clarify and convey his thoughts and ideas to both himself and his readers.  He has real presentation skills with a strong voice and presence when in front of the class.  The poetry unit coming up will be a good opportunity for Stephen to combine his ideas with various poetic structures, and I am hoping he will come to enjoy some of those structures.  He does not know how smart he is – and he and I have agreed that we are going to try to find that out next semester."Brems,"Tayla takes so much pleasure in learning!  Her writing style is excellent and continues to evolve.  She is gaining confidence in the various forms of communication we study, actually welcoming the challenges the new forms offer.  She also seems to be trusting her own thinking more than she used to.  She also seems to be answering her own doubts that she used to express about assignments and answers.   Tayla is becoming an exceptional and complete student.   The writing contest is coming up in February, and I have every anticipation that Tayla will enter."Brems,"Thandiwe is doing so well!  She is an enthusiastic learner and up for any challenges that come her way.  She enjoys “playing” with thinking and understandings, making teaching her a delight.  Her writing is excellent as evidenced by her five-paragraph essay for the semester assessment, and her effort appears effortless.  I think that she will really have fun with the units we will be covering this second semester."Brems,"Vyan’s writing has improved very much this semester, his five-paragraph essay for the semester assessment being his best writing to date.   More importantly, he really seems to enjoy writing, getting his ideas on paper giving him a sense of accomplishment.  He is applying the grammar and punctuation that we are studying in class to his writing as well, a task that is not easy to do but which seems to come to him naturally.  In class discussions he is active and often provides meaningful insights.  He is also developing a very solid presentation style.  I am sure that the upcoming units will be to his liking, particularly the poetry unit."Chilton,Adam is a creative and enthusiastic participant in music class.

This will require further consistency in his revision of content at home."Lataburu,"Alex has been doing well, yet I would still like for him to gather up a little more consistency and confidence and be a little more proactive in class. I think that the new, weekly speaking activities, along with a second semester focused more intensely on topic-related vocabulary, will definitely boost his ability to communicate in controlled, familiar situations, which in turn will help with his confidence. Now that there is a somewhat sound structural basis, all we need to do is roll on!"Lataburu,"Alex is slowly managing to liberate himself from the burden of thinking of a finished product first rather than focusing on the process. This has helped him gather some more confidence in the fact that language is flexible, and our role at the moment is to learn and experiment with it by utilising the tools at our disposal. He is more focused now."Lataburu,Aryana manages her command of concepts and content quite well and has taken on a very helpful role in class. I would like for her to continue writing in her diary as often as she can.Lataburu,"Bryant has a gifted mind for languages, and this is a fact.

I actually need him to balance that with the thought of ""sharing is caring"" We all win if he becomes more communicative."Lataburu,"Fabio has gained confidence and his proactive role in class has improved. He needs to pay more attention to conjugations and use of connectors. The new approach to our learning in the second semester, focused more intensely on topic-related vocabulary, will definitely boost his confidence to communicate in controlled, familiar situations, yet it will require a lot more consistent revision and application of specific vocabulary. Keeping his diary on Google current will help him gain rhythm."Lataburu,"Helena has been working well and has continued to welcome the challenges that the first semester brought with our intense embrace of grammar, conceptual interlacing of topics and choice of format. She will now surely benefit from a new, more specific approach to content as this will help her adopt more subjects of conversation in a more controlled, familiar environment of communication. "Lataburu,"Ishaan is slowly managing to liberate himself from the burden of thinking of a finished product first rather than focusing on the process. This has helped him gather more confidence in the fact that language is flexible, and our role at the moment is to learn and experiment with it by utilising the tools at our disposal. I am equally certain that the new approach to our learning in the second semester, focused more intensely on topic-related vocabulary will definitely boost his ability to communicate in controlled, familiar situations, which in turn will help with his confidence."Lataburu,"Kesia has a gifted mind for languages, and this is a fact. She is also a child of such a good, timid nature, that she prefers to keep from communicating that knowledge rather than share it. I appreciate that, yet I actually need her to balance that thought with the thought of ""sharing is caring"" We all win if she becomes more communicative. Kesia, in turn, would benefit from paying more attention to detail whilst she is in the process of producing written work, as her choice of conjugation is at times inaccurate or mistaken. There is nothing wrong with checking things twice."Lataburu,"Kilian has been doing well, yet I would still like for him to gather up a little more confidence in himself in order to be a little more proactive in class. This will require consistency in his revision of content at home, but I am also quite certain that the more specific approach to content that I have chosen for the second semester will help, as our conversations and projects will revolve around more controlled, familiar content."Lataburu,"Lisa has a natural predisposition to learning and is working hard in languages; this is a fact. This makes me proud.  She is also a child of such a good, timid nature, that she prefers to avoid communicating that knowledge to others at times, rather than to share it. I appreciate that, yet I actually need her to balance that thought with the thought of ""sharing is caring"" We all win if she becomes more communicative. Lisa, in turn, will this second term benefit from a more specific syllabus, where topics will be more relatable as vocabularies expand. We will also introduce weekly speaking sessions and bi-weekly quizzes in order to reassure use of the content learned."Lataburu,"Loredana will certainly benefit from the specificity of topics and approach that I have chosen for the second semester, as I am sure this will now help her be a little more confident, proactive and consistent with her written work. "Lataburu,"Louis has been doing well, yet I would still like for him to gather up a little more confidence in himself in order to be a little more proactive in class.

She needs to pay more attention to conjugation and use of connectors yet I am very satisfied with her progression. The new approach to our learning in the second semester, focused more intensely on topic-related vocabulary, will definitely boost her ability to communicate in controlled, familiar situations. I look forward to it."Lataburu,"My advice to Adam is that he be consistent in his revision of content learned, improve his organisational skills, and reflect more about what kinds of choices he needs to make in regards to commitment to this subject. Adam's challenge comes in the application of content learned, not in either acquiring or understanding that content."Lataburu,"My advice to Stephen is that he be consistent in his revision of content learned, improve his organisational skills, and reflect more about what kinds of choices he needs to make in regards to commitment to this subject. Stephen's challenge comes in the application of content learned, not in either acquiring or understanding that content."Lataburu,"Natasha would surely benefit from paying a little more attention to detail whilst she is in the process of producing written work, as her choice of conjugation is at times either inaccurate or mistaken. There is nothing wrong with checking things twice. Other than that, I am very satisfied with her progress and consistent work."Lataburu,"Noa manages her command of concepts and content quite well and has taken on a very helpful role in class by contributing her opinions on choice of tense and format. I would like for her to continue writing in her diary as consistently as often as she can so that she may manage to liberate herself from occasional lack of attention to detail in terms of specific conjugations. Having said that, it is quite normal to want to pay more attention to developing an idea and communicating it well rather than checking for accuracy, so this will naturally take its time. "Lataburu,"Salome has gained confidence and her proactive role in class has improved. She needs to pay more attention to conjugations and use of connectors, yet I am very satisfied with her progress. The new approach to our learning in the second semester, focused more intensely on topic-related vocabulary, will definitely boost her ability to communicate in controlled, familiar situations.
