Replace all empty cells in a dataframe by NA

```{r}
data$col2[data$col2 == ""] <- NA
```


Replace all the "e" in a df by z
```{r}
gsub("e", "z", df)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
