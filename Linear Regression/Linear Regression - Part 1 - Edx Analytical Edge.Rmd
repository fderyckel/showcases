Linear regression is one of the easiest tool in the predicitve analytics field.  This paper intends to show by example how to make it works with R using the great libraries of dplyr, ggplot2 whenever necessary.  

##Single variable regression.

The general equation for a linear regression model

> $y^i = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} x^i + \epsilon^i$

where:

* $y^i$ is the $i^{th}$ observation of the dependent variable
* $\beta_{0}$ is the intercept coefficient
* $\beta_{1}$ is the regression coefficient for the dependent variable
* $x^i$ is the $i^{th}$ observation of the independent variable 
* $\epsilon^i$ is the error term for the $i^{th}$ observation.  It basically is the difference in therm of y between the observed value and the estimated value.  It is also called the residuals. A good model minimize these errors.

Some ways to assess how good our model is to:

1.  compute the SSE (the sum of squared error)
    + SSE = $(\epsilon^1)^2 + (\epsilon^2)^2 + \ldots + (\epsilon^n)^2$ = $\sum_{i=1}^N \epsilon^i$
    + A good model will minimize SSE
    + problem: SSE is dependent of N.  SSE will naturally increase as N increase
2.  compute the RMSE (the root mean squared error)
    + RMSE = $\sqrt {\frac {SSE} {N}}$
    + + Also a good model will minimize SSE
    + It depends of the unit of the independent variable
3.  compute $R^2$
    + It compare the models to a baseline model
    + $R^2$ is **unitless** and **universaly** interpretable
    + SST is the sum of the squared of the difference between the observed value and the mean of all the observed value

> $R^2 = 1 - \frac {SSE} {SST}$

###In practice.
####First example.  Predicting wine price.
The wine.csv file is used in the class.  

Let's load it and then have a quick look at its structure.
```{r}
wine = read.csv("wine.csv")
str(wine)
head(wine)
```

We use the `lm` function to find our linear regression model.  We use *AGST* as the independent variable while the *price* is the dependent variable.
```{r}
model1 = lm(Price ~ AGST,data=wine)
summary(model1)
```

The `summary` function applied on the model is giving us a bunch of important information

  * the stars next to the predictor variable indicated how significant the variable is for our regression model
  * it also gives us the value of the R coefficient

We could have calculated the R value ourselves:
```{r}
SSE = sum(model1$residuals^2)
SST = sum((wine$Price - mean(wine$Price))^2)
r_squared = 1 - SSE/SST
r_squared
```

We can now plot the observations and the line of regression; and see how the linear model fits the data.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(wine, aes(AGST, Price)) + geom_point(col="blue") + geom_smooth(method="lm", col="red")
```

It is always nice to see how our residuals are distributed.  
We use the `ggplot2` library and the `fortify` function which transform the `summary(model1)` into a data frame usable for plotting. 
```{r}
model1 <- fortify(model1)
ggplot(model1, aes(.fitted, .resid)) + geom_point() + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, col = "red", linetype = "dashed") + xlab("Fitted values") + ylab("Residuals") + ggtitle("Plot of the residuals in function of the fitted values")
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
